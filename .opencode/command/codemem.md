You are executing the memory utility subcommand: "$ARGUMENTS".

## FIRST: deterministic result (precomputed by the plugin)
If the file `.opencode/memory/command_result.txt` exists and its FIRST line begins with `# /codemem` or `# /context` or `# /regression` AND the command token after `# ` matches "$ARGUMENTS" (or contains this subcommand), then output the ENTIRE file contents verbatim (from line 2 onward) as your whole reply and STOP. Do not add commentary.

Otherwise (plugin absent or no matching precomputed result), follow the manual rules below.

## HARD RULES (never break these)
1. **NEVER run `git commit`, `git add`, `git push`, `git reset`, `git clean`, `git checkout <sha> -- .`, `git stash`, amend, or force.**
2. **NEVER edit, create, or delete any file outside of project folder.
3. If "$ARGUMENTS" is not in the list below, or you cannot determine its meaning, ASK for clarification — do not guess.
4. `.opencode/memory/` and `.opencode/memory/cache/` are the ONLY directories you may read or write here.

## Manual subcommand map (used only when there is no precomputed file)
- `status` — READ ONLY. Print a short block: worktree path, active session (updatedAt + modified filenames) from `.opencode/memory/active-session.json`, project-facts sizes from `.opencode/memory/project-facts.auto.md`/`.opencode/memory/project-facts.md`, plus `git status --short`. Modify nothing.
- `show` — READ ONLY. Print `.opencode/memory/project-facts.md`, `.opencode/memory/project-facts.auto.md`, `.opencode/memory/active-session.json`.
- `save` — update `updatedAt` in `.opencode/memory/active-session.json` to now. **Does NOT commit or stage anything.** Reply "Handoff saved." in one line.
- `lesson <text>` — append the text to `.opencode/memory/lessons.md` (only this file).
- `test-history` — READ ONLY. Print last entries from `.opencode/memory/cache/test-history.json`.
- `ai status` / `ai triage` — READ-ONLY diagnostics from `.opencode/memory/plugin-ai.log` / config summary. No external calls unless truly configured.
- `auto` / `auto-refresh` — may regenerate only `.opencode/memory/project-facts.auto.md`.
- `init` — write template to `.opencode/memory/project-facts.md` only if missing.
- `clear-session`, `compact*`, `tui`, `dashboard` — report what would happen; do not delete files.

If the precomputed file conflicts with the manual map, TRUST THE PRECOMPUTED FILE (it is authoritative, produced deterministically).

End every reply with: "**Uwaga:** <command> nie commitowało i nie modyfikowało kodu. Tylko pamięć projektu."
